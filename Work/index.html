        <br>DIRECTIONS
        <br>1)
        <br>In a large mixing bowl, combine milk, 
        <br>vanilla pudding mix and sweetened    
        <br>condensed milk. Whisk thoroughly,
        <br>breaking up any lumps, and
        <br>refrigerate for at least 5 minutes, or
        <br>until set.
        <br>2)
        <br>In another large bowl, combine heavy
        <br>cream and vanilla. Beat until stiff
        <br>peaks form, 2 to 3 minutes. Set aside
        <br>half of the mixture for topping the
        <br>dish. Fold remaining half into the
        <br>pudding mixture.
        <br>3)
        <br>Cover the bottom of a 3-quart trifle
        <br>dish with vanilla wafers. Top with
        <br>one-third of the pudding mixture.
        <br>Cover with another layer of the wafer
        <br>cookies—you may want to also stand
        <br>some cookies up vertically, so you see
        <br>the full circle along the edge of the
        <br>trifle dish. Top with an even layer of
        <br>banana slices. Continue layering the
        <br>pudding, wafer cookies and banana
        <br>slices until you reach the top, ending
        <br>with a final layer of banana pudding.
        <br>4)
        <br>Refrigerate for at least 3 hours, or up
        <br>to overnight.
        <br>5)
        <br>Sweeten the remaining whipped
        <br>cream: Add sugar to whipped cream,
        <br>stirring to combine. Just before
        <br>serving, dollop on top of the banana
        <br>pudding, then sprinkle crumbled
        <br>wafer cookies on top.
